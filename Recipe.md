# HOW TO MAKE THE SUGAR COOKIE DOUGH 
1. *Add the 4 sticks (2 cups) of butter and 2 cups of white sugar to your mixer.  A word about the butter, we use Sweet Cream Salted Butter when we are baking and I think it tastes great with these sugar cookies too.  The butter needs to be softened but still cold.  A prime culprit for dry sugar cookie dough is butter than is too warm and soft.  I let the butter sit out on the counter for just under an hour before I start making the cookies – this seems to be the perfect amount of time for me.  The butter is still cold to the touch but you can press into the stick with your fingers. In the past, when in a rush, I have softened the butter in the microwave but inevitably the dough that I get is on the “crumbly” side.*
2. *Cream the butter and sugar until it is completely mixed.*
3. *Add 2 tablespoons of vanilla and 2 eggs. I know that sounds like a lot of vanilla but this recipe needs a little extra moisture and the cookies will taste great.*
4. *Mix the cookie dough until light and fluffy.*

# BAKING INSTRUCTIONS

* *Bake at 350 degrees for 6-8 minutes depending on the size of the cookie.  Do not over-bake!  We like thicker sugar cookies so they will hold a good amount of frosting.  If you make your cookies on the thick side you should cook them 9-10 minutes but not much longer. They might not look done to you but they are.  Take them out of the oven.  You don’t want them to start browning around the edges the way you would with Chocolate Chip Cookies for example.  Over-baking is the prime culprit if you feel your sugar cookies seem dry.  If you roll out thinner cookies, or use smaller cookie cutters than the ones we have used here, you  should only bake the cookies 6 or 7 minutes.*


* *This recipe will make a lot of cookies but the actual number depends on the size of the cookie cutters you are using.  Using these large-ish cookie cutters, we made 36 cookies.  If you only need a couple of dozen cookies, you can cut this recipe in half.*

* *These cookies taste amazing and they really hold their shape. And most importantly, they don’t poof up too much or flatten out into a cookie blob.*


# FROSTING YOUR SUGAR COOKIES

* *Let your cookies cool and then they are ready for frosting.  We use our Best Buttercream Frosting recipe with these Best Sugar Cookies.  The frosting is easy to color and tastes so delicious and yummy on these Sugar Cookies.*
